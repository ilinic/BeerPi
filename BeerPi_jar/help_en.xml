    <caption>Electrical safety regulations for the operation of the brewery</caption>
    <desc>The brewery is a 380 volt high-power electrical industrial equipment that poses a threat to human life and health. The brewery also operates in a humid environment, which increases the risk of electric shock. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly observe the safety rules during the operation and maintenance of equipment. The brewery {model} should be connected to 380 volt industrial frequency AC mains. The body of the brewery, as well as the metal piping of hot and cold water and steam pipelines must be grounded with a conductor with a cross section of at least 10 sq. Mm. Grounding conductors must be connected at two points, one of which is on the boiler body, and the second on the cold or hot water pipe outside the cooking room and no closer than 5 m from the first point. The installation must be connected to the network through a residual current device or through a 25 amp three-phase differential circuit breaker.</desc>

    <caption>Rules for the safe use of steam and glycol shirts</caption>
    <desc>Boiler shirts are pressurized to 0.5 bar and operate at temperatures up to 110 degrees C. During operation, do not touch heated surfaces without protective equipment in order to avoid burns, prevent heating in the absence of liquid in the boiler, and do not place parts under voltage (control unit, power wires) near water sources, operate in a ventilated room, avoid humidity in the room at which condensation starts to fall, do not place on uneven, unstable surfaces, observe safety measures when working with heating appliances. Steam-water shirts are under pressure up to 0.5 bar, equipped with a safety valve (operating both for overpressure and for discharge), during operation it is necessary to monitor the pressure to prevent exceeding the specified thresholds. The temperature of the coolant of steam-water and glycol jackets can reach 110 degrees C. When opening the taps of the shirt, it is necessary to use protective gloves made of thick cloth and be out of the line of discharge of steam or liquid.</desc>

    <caption>Recipe chain selection</caption>
    <desc>Brewery {model} is a model with two active boilers, which allows up to 4 brews per shift due to the simultaneous operation of both boilers. When using a boiler with a supply of hot water and a separate standing whirlpool, it becomes possible to perform up to 6 brews of beer per shift due to the acceleration of the heating phases and faster release of the digester at the stage of virulence. The Ceres software is designed to fulfill the chains of recipes that are set in the corresponding section of the software. Both repeated cooking of one recipe and successive cooking of various recipes are possible. Thus, when the brewery with two active boilers is actively loaded, two recipes are simultaneously executed on the equipment. When cooking parallel recipes, the system automatically synchronizes the speed to avoid violation of prescription algorithms (exceeding mash or cooking pauses). Parameters of timeouts, time tolerances, wort overflow time between boilers are set in the parameters section. When selecting recipes, a color map of the execution and estimated time points are displayed when operator intervention is necessary.</desc>

    <caption>Create, edit, import recipes</caption>
    <desc>Creating or editing recipes comes from the section with a list of recipes. Importing a recipe from the BeerSmith package is done in the recipe editing window from the root directory of USB drives, which can be connected at the back of the brewery control unit. In the recipe settings window, you need to set the basic volumes of the recipe, the mass of the ingredients, and the water parameters. For the mash stage, the temperatures and durations of mash pauses are indicated. If the operator message text is set for a pause, the system will give an audible (optional) and text notification for the operator and begin to count the pause only after the operator completes the action. At the brewing stage, temporary pauses mean the intervals between hops and other additives. The recipe editing window has a convenient menu for editing mash or cooking steps of the recipe.</desc>

    <caption>Washing and disinfection</caption>
    <desc>There are two types of washing - washing and disinfecting the inside of boilers and pipelines and washing the outside of the brewery using high-pressure units. To wash the internal surfaces, the boilers themselves are used to heat the flushing solutions, and the circulation pumps - to create a cleaning fluid flow. Flushing of internal cavities is carried out in the manual control mode of the brewery by setting the power of the heating elements. Before cleaning the brewery body with a high-pressure washer, completely disconnect the installation. It is strictly forbidden to wash the automation unit in a high-pressure cleaner to prevent water from entering the power electronics. In case of contamination, disconnect the entire installation and wipe the case with slightly damp rags.</desc>

    <caption>Brewery Maintenance Schedule</caption>
    <desc>Maintenance of the brewery consists in regular inspection of all work units for serviceability and integrity. Particular attention should be paid to the search for violations of the tightness of heating jackets, the integrity of the body of the product, and other electrical equipment, insulation of electrical wiring, and grounding reliability. Shift maintenance should be carried out by maintenance personnel and includes: regular external inspection, cleaning and wiping of housings and working devices, checking the availability and serviceability of grounding, and monitoring the tightness of heating jackets. At least once every three months, it is necessary to check the condition of the wiring and the control system for external damage. At least once a year, places for grounding bolts are cleaned to a shine and coated with TsIATIM-201 grease according to GOST 6267-74.
Every three months, it is necessary to check the tightness of the threaded connections (tighten if loosened). When working with detergents and disinfectants, care must be taken to use rubber gloves and follow the instructions.</desc>

    <caption>Failure Actions</caption>
    <desc>The brewery {model} is made with a certain margin of resistance to failures. In the event of a failure in the power supply of the brewery, work will be resumed from the moment of interruption, if the break did not exceed the threshold value of the time duration, which is set in the settings. If the time threshold is exceeded, the recipe will be completed. If the running parallel recipes (or one recipe) were interrupted without the possibility of renewal for any other reasons, then it is possible to complete the cooking in manual mode to avoid product loss. To do this, open both recipes and write down the necessary steps, then open the history section and determine at which step each of the recipes was interrupted. Then, in the recipe window, make a duplicate of the recipe from the mash pot, then edit it by deleting the steps that have been taken. And run the recipe for execution. Bring the recipe in the mash boiler to the end in manual mode by adjusting the boiling power of the power buttons and loading the hops and other ingredients according to the time count that you will conduct yourself.</desc>
